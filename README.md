Title: Python Scripts & Automation

**** Renaming_Files.py *****

To use this program to rename files, all you need to do is specify the Keyword that you want the filenames to have, as well as the Company Name. Once you have entered these details
at the bottom of the file, all you need to do then is specify the file path where all the images are stored. 

Run the script using Python Launcher, or run it by using your command prompt to go to where the python file is, and execute it using the following command:
'python your_file.py'.

You should get a messsage saying whether the execution was successful or not.
